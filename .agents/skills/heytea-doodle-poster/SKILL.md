# Heytea Doodle Poster, Flavor Monster, and Desktop Pet

Create unofficial visual work inspired by the playful HEYTEA poster language: rough black marks, awkward handmade shapes, generous white space, and restrained object-led storytelling.

Do not add official HEYTEA logos, mascots, packaging marks, or claims of affiliation unless the user supplies authorized assets and explicitly requests their use.

## Photo entry and routing

Require and inspect an uploaded image before visual generation. Resolve the subject first:

- If no usable subject is visible, stop and ask for one sharp, well-lit, unobstructed subject.
- If several independent subjects are visible, give short numbered descriptions and ask which one to use. Do not silently choose.
- Treat a container and its contents as one subject unless the user asks otherwise.

When the user uploads a usable photo without saying what to make, offer exactly these three choices and do not generate or run environment checks yet:

1. 生成带字版海报
2. 生成不带字海报
3. 生成一张风味小怪兽

If the user already asked for a text poster, no-text poster, flavor monster, or both poster versions, enter that workflow directly without repeating the chooser. “两套都出” remains supported but is not a fourth default choice. An explicit 写实卡通桌宠 or `source-faithful` request remains supported but is not shown in the default three choices.

## Ordinary poster

Read `references/style-guide.md`; for `带字版`, also read `references/lettering-guide.md`.

- Keep the photographed object recognizable and photographic. Do not cartoonize the full image.
- Inspect `private-assets/reference-cutouts/asset-index.json` when it exists.
- A text poster uses separate poster-base, title-construction-sheet, and title-layer steps. Use `scripts/build_title_reference_sheet.py` and `scripts/composite_title_layer.py` when applicable.
- A no-text poster forbids all text and lets one primitive micro-worker action tell the story.
- When making both versions, create two genuinely different concepts and compositions rather than toggling a title on one base image.

Use `references/evaluation.md` for final review.

## Static flavor-monster identity

Read `references/desktop-pet-character-modes.md`, the identity stages of `references/desktop-pet-workflow.md`, and `references/mixed-media-style-guide.md`. Do not read or run the environment workflow yet.

Build one best `flavor-monster` identity on white or warm white. Before drawing, complete the four contracts defined in `references/desktop-pet-character-modes.md`: a `source relation map`, `outline construction brief`, `face construction brief`, and `material layer map`. The photo controls those contracts; the public example and study boards may control only their explicitly assigned style or construction axis.

Keep these identity gates in force:

- at least one non-color source signal changes the outer body topology while remaining abstract and separate from exactly two black-line arms plus two black-line legs;
- the default face is two clear eyes and one clear friendly mouth below them, using `readability > friendliness > identity distinctiveness > handmade irregularity`; experimental faces require an explicit request;
- the body uses one heavy irregular structural boundary, while broad dry wax-crayon layers preserve source containment, accumulation, overlap, and top-layer position; paper-white is optional and must not sever those relations;
- the public example and reference boards never supply a new silhouette, face layout, limb skeleton, object, text, or anatomical coordinates.

Follow the mandatory two-stage construction and focused-repair rules in `references/desktop-pet-workflow.md`. Use `contact_sheet_single_pass_rough_line_v1.png` only for the black-line stage and `contact_sheet_crayon_layer_v1.png` only for the line-locked color stage, as defined in `references/mixed-media-style-guide.md` and the asset index.

Approve the black-line master at full size, a representative 300% crop, and 120–140 px before adding color without changing any accepted black mark. Review the colored identity against `references/evaluation.md`, then ask for explicit identity approval or a focused revision. Do not generate a fusion poster, motion, runtime assets, or a package before approval. Approval establishes the canonical identity shared by later branches.

After approval, ask whether to:

1. 制作融合海报；
2. 继续制作可运行桌宠；
3. 两者都做。

## Approved-monster fusion poster

Read `references/monster-poster-workflow.md` plus the ordinary poster references needed for the requested variant. Ask whether the user wants 带字版、无字版或两套都做 unless already stated.

Use the original uploaded photo and the approved canonical monster. Keep the photographed product unchanged and photographic; lock the monster's identity while adapting only its pose for one clear interaction. Text and no-text versions must use independent compositions.

This branch never requires desktop-runner preflight. If the user selected both fusion poster and runnable pet, continue the poster branch even when the runner is missing or installation is declined.

## Runnable desktop pet

Read `references/desktop-pet-workflow.md`, `references/desktop-pet-environment.md`, `references/mixed-media-style-guide.md`, and `references/desktop-pet-pack.md`.

- For an approved `flavor-monster`, run `python3 scripts/desktop_pet.py doctor --json --required-schema 3` only now, before motion generation. The older `scripts/check_desktop_pet_environment.py` entry is a shim for the same command. Do not pass `--probe-registry` unless diagnosing npm connectivity.
- For an explicit `source-faithful` request, first complete its three-candidate identity workflow and obtain explicit canonical-identity approval; then run the same environment gate before motion generation. Source-faithful remains schema v2 and flavor-monster uses schema v3.
- If preflight reports missing or outdated components, explain the exact plan and request consent immediately before installation or upgrade. Never silently install or replace software, bypass operating-system warnings, or enable launch-at-login.
- Continue only after preflight reports `ready`. Then create the mode-specific motion set, request motion approval, and only after approval run `python3 scripts/desktop_pet.py pack <pet-dir>` to build, validate, and write the delivery folder. The older `build_desktop_pet_pack.py` / `validate_desktop_pet_pack.py` scripts remain callable.

For schema-v1 migration, preserve the original pack, create a new v2 draft, add the four missing states, and require fresh motion approval. Never overwrite or silently activate the v1 pack.

White backgrounds are for identity and motion review only. Runtime animation files require real alpha transparency.

## Output boundary

- Never describe exploratory image-model output as a finished pet pack.
- Do not fabricate file paths, validation results, or runnable installers.
- If visual generation is unavailable, return the staged prompt packet and state which artifacts remain ungenerated.
- Do not save generation prompts as standalone project documents unless the user explicitly asks for prompt files.
- Treat official-looking marks, private-study-only cutouts, and `quality: avoid-default` records as analysis-only.
- Preserve user files and unrelated working-tree changes.

Human visual approval is mandatory at both desktop-pet gates; automated validation cannot replace it.
